Bonus
=====

The bonus portion uses a fast fourier transform to determine the dominant spectral component of a WAV file.
The FFT was adapted from Jon Harrop's post at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10121574/safe-and-fast-fft

Different powers of two can be defined for the FFT length with the FFT_LEN preprocessor directive.

To run the bonus portion:
