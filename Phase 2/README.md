Phase 2
=======

Phase 2 removes the sine wave added in Phase 1.
There are two options for the filters, a coarse grained but fast lowpass filter, and a much higher quality (and much slower) bandpass filter.

Run as:

381-project \<input filename\> \<output filename\> [h]

Defaults to coarse lowpass filter, for high quality (bandpass, fine grain) filter add h at end.
