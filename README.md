WAV File Sine-Wave Add and Filter
=================================

Project from CPE 381 of University of Alabama in Huntsville.

Adds a  sine wave at 2500 Hz into a WAV file (Phase 1), then removes it using one of several filters (Phase 2). Additionally, it can apply a FFT to a WAV file to find the dominant spectrum (Bonus).

Uses void and function pointers to allow objected-oriented flexibility while avoiding the overhead that using C++ classes would involve.

Usage instructions for each part are included in the relevant directories.
